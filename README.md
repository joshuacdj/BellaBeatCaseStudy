# How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?
## Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Specialisation

## Background:
Bellabeat is a wellness tech company that empowers women through data-driven insights and innovative products. Founded in 2013, Bellabeat offers smart devices like fitness trackers and health monitors to help women improve their overall well-being with personalized recommendations.

The cofounders of Bellabeat are eager to delve into data from non-Bellabeat fitness devices to uncover how consumers are using these products. By gaining these insights, the company aims to craft innovative marketing strategies that will captivate and engage their target audience even more effectively.

### Products
* Bellabeat app: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress,
menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and
make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.
* Leaf: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects
to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.
* Time: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user
activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your
daily wellness.
* Spring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are
appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your
hydration levels.
* Bellabeat membership: Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users.
Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and
beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

## Step 1: Ask

### 1.1: Business Task 
To uncover insights that will inform their marketing strategies, Bellabeat plans to 
analyze consumer data from non-Bellabeat smart devices.

### 1.2: Stakeholders
1. Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
2. Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
3. Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting
data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

### 1.3: Guiding Questions:
What are the trends in fitness trackers in the market?
How do these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
How do we use these trends to shape the marketing strategy for Bellabeat?

## Step 2: Prepare

### 2.1: Data
FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius)

* Description:
This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

### 2.2: Data Organisation
There are 18 CSV files storing data.  Fitbit tracks a variety of different quantitative data and represents them in each CSV file.

The data is in long format. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a specific time point for a subject, meaning each user has multiple entries. Users are identified by unique IDs, with their data recorded by day and time.

### 2.3: Data Bias & Credibility

1. There is a limitation of 30 users. This means that the data may not be fully representative of the population we are trying to analyze/
2. We do not know further demographic details about the users who were surveyed, so there may have been a sampling bias.
3. We do not know how the survey was conducted and the specific questions that were asked. There could have been leading questions, which might influence the responses and skew the results.
4. The dataset is outdated, which may not reflect current user behaviors and trends.
5. The survey's limited duration of 2 months might not capture longer-term patterns and variations in user behavior.

### 2.4: Licensing, Privacy, Security & Accessibility

The dataset is open-source, meaning it is freely available for use, modification, and distribution under an open-source license. This promotes transparency and collaboration, allowing researchers and developers to leverage the data for various analyses and applications.

The data is anonymized as well, as we do not have any accessed to the identifying personal information of the users directly from the dataset.

## Step 3: Process

I am using R as my primary tool of data analysis, as the dataset is rather large and I want to have the ease of creating visualisations as well. 

### 3.1: Files Chosen:

For a more logical and convenient timeframe, I will select the datasets that are only by the day. All other datasets involving seconds or minutes would not be enough to provide a macro view of any interesting relationships / trends.

Hence, I have chosen the following 6 datasets:

1. dailyActivity_merged.csv
2. dailyCalories_merged.csv
3. dailyIntensities_merged.csv
4. dailySteps_merged.csv
5. sleepDay_merged.csv
6. weightLogInfo_merged.csv
    
---

<!-- ### 3.2: Quick Parse
* Removed 3 duplicate rows found in sleepDay_merged.csv. 
* All other datasets had no duplicate rows nor whitespaces that needed trimming.
* For weightLogInfo_merged.csv, there were a total of 65 blank cells in the 'Fat' column. I decided to drop the column as only it only has 2 non-blank values. -->

### 3.3 Data Set Up and Cleaning
1. Load the tidyverse packages

```
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

2. Load files
   
```
    activities <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
    calories <- read_csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
    intensities <- read_csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
    steps <- read_csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
    sleeps <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
    weights <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")

```

3. Check if data has been loaded

```
    head(activities)
    head(calories)
    head(intensities)
    head(steps)
    head(sleeps)
    head(weights)
```

4. Check structure of data sets

```
    str(activities)
    str(calories)
    str(intensities)
    str(steps)
    str(sleeps)
    str(weights)
```

6. Cleaning and Formatting

Now I will check the unique users per tibble

```
n_unique(activities$Id)
n_unique(calories$Id)
n_unique(intensities$Id)
n_unique(steps$Id)
n_unique(sleeps$Id)
n_unique(weights$Id)
```

From the result, I can see that there are 33 unique users per tibble, except for sleeps (24) and weights (8).
I will drop the weights dataset as it is too small to make appropriate conclusions representative of the population.

Even though the sleeps dataset is still less than 30, which is the recommended minimum sample size, in this case, 
I feel like 24 is a number that is relatively close enough to 33, which is the maximum sample size out of all the 
datasets. Furthermore, I believe that the sleeps dataset provides useful insights about participants' sleep schedules which we may 
take advantage of in our marketing strategy.
